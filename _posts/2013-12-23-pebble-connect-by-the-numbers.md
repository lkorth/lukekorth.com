A few days ago Pebble posted a [Facebook update about pebbleNav](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=752300254799875&set=a.420451041318133.109642.410852228944681&type=1&theater)
serving 30,000 routes since it's last update. I haven't looked at the numbers for [Pebble Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lukekorth.httpebble) in a while,
so I decided to compile them all and share them. (All numbers are as of December 23rd, 2013)

<div class="list">
	<ul>
		<li>20,824 total downloads</li>
		<li>13,236 active users</li>
		<li>2,670 users have enabled cloud access since its release in June 2013 (IFTTT integration and RESTful API)</li>
		<li>89,002 notifications have been sent to Pebbles via IFTTT since June 2013</li>
		<li>16,218 notifications have been sent to Pebbles via API since June 2013</li>
		<li>1,500,000+ requests per week to the Yahoo weather httpebble API I host (around 150 requests per minute or 2.5 per second)</li>
		<li>httpebble weather requests have peaked at over 350+ requests per second</li>
	</ul>
