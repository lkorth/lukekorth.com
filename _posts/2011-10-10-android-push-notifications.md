I'll be giving a talk at [Iowa Code Camp](http://iowacodecamp.com/) this month on
Android's Cloud to Device Messaging, C2DM. The source code from the talk can be found
<del>here</del> (Update: Google has moved to GCM and now to FCM and has [extensive
documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/) on their website).
This talk is based on a portion of the work I did on my
[Facebook Notifications App](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.lukekorth.facebookNotifications).
