I'm a big fan of [500px](http://500px.com/), from time to time I post [my photos](https://500px.com/LukeKorth) there and
I'll happily spend hours looking through the amazing photos that others have posted. One day I was staring at the same
boring wallpaper on my phone and I thought it would be really nice to have a live wallpaper that used photos from 500px.
Unsurprisingly [there are several in the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=500px+wallpaper&c=apps)
ranging from really bad to pretty good. I gave them a try, but I wasn't very happy with them. Several of them
are freemium and most of the ones I've tried are live wallpapers and continuously use a lot of ram.
It also bugged me that none of them were open source.

After thinking about if for a little while, I decided to develop my own app that automatically updates the
wallpaper instead of being a live wallpaper. Using a few libraries it was very easy to develop in just a
few hours time. Users of the app have a range of options for filtering the type of photos they would like
to see as their wallpaper along with how frequently they should update. I've released
[Photo Paper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lukekorth.android_500px) to the Play Store
and it is also [open source](https://github.com/lkorth/photo-paper) on GitHub.
