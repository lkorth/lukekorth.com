title: Goodbye httpebble

Pebble 2.0 for Android has been out for 
[just under a month now](https://blog.getpebble.com/2014/03/07/the-pebble-appstore-now-with-android-support-and-more-partners/). 
With the great majority of new and updated apps using JavaScript for their network and location needs, it's time to say 
goodbye to httpebble. Later today I will be shutting down the httpebble weather endpoints I have been running and by 
this weekend there will be an update for 
[Pebble Connect with httpebble](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lukekorth.httpebble) to remove httpebble 
support and rename the app to Pebble Connect. 

For those using IFTTT or the RESTful API through Pebble Connect everything will continue to work just as it does now.
