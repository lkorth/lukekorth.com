The app is back with a new name:
[Slk Notifications for Facebook](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.lukekorth.facebookNotifications).
The logo and name change were a requirement of Facebook due to their trademarks. I have also set up a new, much
faster server to send notifications and they should be much better now. Big thanks to the
writers of [Rolling Curl](http://code.google.com/p/rolling-curl/) for their very handy PHP class.
As time allows I will be updating the app and hopefully releasing a paid version soon.
