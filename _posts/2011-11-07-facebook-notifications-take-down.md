Facebook has sent me a DMCA takedown notice for copyright infringement so my Facebook Notifications
app has been taken off the market. I am working to get it back on, but in the mean time you can
find it [<del>here</del>](#). Please check back here from time to time, I will post updates and let you know
when my app is back on the market. I am also working on shortening the delay in the notifications
and some issues people have been having with not getting notifications.
