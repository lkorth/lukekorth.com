  I enjoy writting software professionally and in my free time and am an avid photographer. My blog is primarily about things I've
  worked on or find interesting, as well as a place to document and keep track of stuff.
  <br><br>
  I love clean, efficient code and value the little things like friendly urls and quick websites.
