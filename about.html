  I'm a builder, hacker, photographer and countless other things. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science
  and seldom a day goes by that I'm not working on the code for something. My blog is primarily about things I am
  working on or have found interesting, as well as a place to keep track of stuff I don't want to forget.

  I love clean, efficient code and value the little things like friendly urls and quick websites.

  I have a number of apps on <a onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Link', 'About', 'Apps']);" href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=luke+korth">Google Play</a> that you should check out.

  If you have any questions or just want to say hi, feel free to
  <a onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Link', 'About', '{{ site.email }}']);" href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email me</a>.
  I can also be found on <a rel="me" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Google+', 'About', 'Google Plus Profile']);" href="https://plus.google.com/115368185500655280641?rel=me">Google+</a> and <a onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'GitHub', 'About', 'GitHub Profile']);" href="https://github.com/lkorth">GitHub</a>.
