        <p>
            I'm a builder, hacker, photographer and countless other things. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science
            and seldom a day goes by that I'm not working on the code for something. My blog is primarily about things I am
            working on or have found interesting, as well as a place to keep track of tidbits I don't want to lose.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love clean, efficient code and value the little things like friendly urls and quick websites.
        </p>

            If you have any questions or just want to say hey, feel free to <a onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Email', 'About', '{{ site.email }}']);" href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">contact me</a>.
			I can also be found on <a onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Google+', 'About', 'Google Plus Profile']);" href="https://plus.google.com/115368185500655280641/posts?rel=author">Google+</a>
			and any of the sites listed in the footer. If you're hiring, why not take a look at my <a href="/resume">resume</a> and see if I'm the person you've been looking for.
