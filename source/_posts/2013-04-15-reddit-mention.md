The [botnet detection](https://github.com/lkorth/botnet-detection) program I started writing a year ago
as part of my senior research has received a few stars and a fork on GitHub randomly and it seems rather odd.
It's far from working and it makes me wonder how/why people stumbled across it.

Later in the day, I got a message from one of my friends saying he had seen a
[mention of it on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1cdnay/a_network_analysis_algorithm_for_detecting_bots/)
in /r/netsec. Pretty cool to know people were taking interest in something I started to build even it it's
far from working and dead at this point. Makes me want to work on it again, I always love security stuff.
