Facebook has sent me a DMCA takedown notice for copyright infringement so my Facebook Notifications
app has been taken off the market. I am working to get it back on the market, but in the mean time you can
find it <del>here</del> (Update: Facebook Notifications is available on the Play store again). 
Please check back here from time to time, I will post updates and let you know when my app is back on the market. 
I am also working on shortening the delay in the notifications and some issues people have been having with not getting notifications.
