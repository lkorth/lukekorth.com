[httpebble](http://kathar.in/httpebble/) is a generic set of rules for a [Pebble watch](http://getpebble.com/)
watch face to communicate with the Internet using a phone as a proxy. It also defines other features such as
location awareness and data storage as well. [httpebble](http://kathar.in/httpebble/) was created to make use of the
[Pebble two-way communication SDK](http://developer.getpebble.com/1/02_Guides/07_CommunicatingPhone).

The initial implementation of [httpebble](http://kathar.in/httpebble/) was several demo apps, the prominent one being
[Weather Watch](https://github.com/Katharine/WeatherWatch), and an [iOS app](https://github.com/Katharine/httpebble-ios).
There was a demand for an Android version of [httpebble](http://kathar.in/httpebble/) as well, so being an
[Android developer](http://lukekorth.com/apps), I built [one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lukekorth.httpebble).
[httppebble for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lukekorth.httpebble) is open source and
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/lkorth/httpebble-android).

I'm very excited for all the possibilities [httpebble](http://kathar.in/httpebble/) enables and look forward to all of the
new watch faces that make use of it.
