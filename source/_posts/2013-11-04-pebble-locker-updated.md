[Pebble Locker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lukekorth.pebblelocker) got an update
today that added functionality to select any Bluetooth device and/or WiFi network to unlock your device.
If your phone or tablet is connected to your Pebble, selected Bluetooth devices or WiFi networks it will remain
unlocked. At any time if it is not connected to any of your selected devices or networks, it will set the lock
screen with your predefined pin/password.

These new features are available via an in-app purchase or to any one that had previously donated $3 or more.

As always, feel free to let me know if you have any issues or would like to see any other features.
Pebble Locker is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lkorth/pebble-locker).
