        I'm a builder, hacker, photographer and countless other things. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science
        and seldom a day goes by that I'm not working on the code for something. My blog is primarily about things I am
        working on or have found interesting, as well as a place to keep track of stuff I don't want to forget.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love clean, efficient code and value the little things like friendly urls and quick websites.
